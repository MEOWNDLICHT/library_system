# Digital Library System

A CLI-based simulation of digital library system that supports basic CRUD operations for managing books, users, authors, and borrowing information. Users are authenticated and given access to varying operations based on their role (librarian/member). Everything about this program is made unnecessarily complex. This has no real value other than for educational purposes.

## How Does It Work?  

Boot the program thru main.py and pretty much everything you need to know will be greeting you there.  
Good luck running it tho.

## Project Structure / Flow  
#### main.py -> presentaion -> services -> data -> model  


main.py - starting point  
presentation - handles the CLI-interactions and display  
services - where the CRUD operations are properly handled and authenticated  
data - where data is stored and updated  
model - where the basic blueprints for accounts, users, and such are handled

## Project Status  

Project is done. (mostly)  
Still needs some polish and cleanup.  
May break if you deliberately mess around with it.

### GOODNIGHT~
